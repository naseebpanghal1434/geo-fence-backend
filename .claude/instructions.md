# Claude Code Instructions for Geo-Fence Backend Repository

## Repository Guidelines

### DO NOT Create Frontend Projects
- **NEVER** create `attendance-admin` or any other frontend/Angular projects in this repository
- This is a **backend-only** repository containing the Spring Boot application
- Keep the repository focused solely on backend Java/Spring Boot code
- Any frontend applications should be created in separate repositories

### Project Structure
- Main backend code is located in `/root/Geo-fence/backend`
- Do not add unrelated projects or folders at the root level of `/root/Geo-fence`

### Best Practices
- Always work within the `backend` directory for Spring Boot changes
- Keep commits focused on backend functionality only
- If frontend work is requested, suggest creating a separate repository
